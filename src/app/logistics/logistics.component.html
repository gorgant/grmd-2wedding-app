          <p>While our July 7th, 2018 Hamilton (Clinton, NY) wedding is still many months away, 
              we have learned that the auspicious date does overlap with a popular local marathon 
              called the Boiler Maker.  Consequently, hotel rooms in the area will be disappearing quickly.
          </p>
          <p>In anticipation of the rush, we have blocked off rooms at the newest and closest hotel to our 
            Hamilton wedding venue.  You can book accommodations at either of the two links below.  The two 
            properties are adjacent to each other and we will have buses to shuttle guests from these 
            locations to Hamilton campus (10 minute drive).  Due to the high demand during that time period, 
            they do require a two-night minimum stay.
